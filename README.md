# Example Projects by Nathan Briese

This repo will host an ever growing list of intersting projects that I have been working on.
As of now the only one that I feel confident publishing is some work that I did in my operating systems class. This small project is a demonstration of how to use threads for parrellelization. Specifically it is an implementation of the map reduce paradigm.

There will be some machine learning projects (and hopefully more on operating systems) coming soon.
