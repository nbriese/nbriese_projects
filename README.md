# Example Projects by Nathan Briese

This repo will host an ever growing list of intersting projects that I have been working on.

I will continue to post projects related to my operating systems and machine learning studies.

First is the multi-thread map-reduce program. This small project is a demonstration of how to use threads for parrellelization.
Additionally, I have posted a preliminary version of my support vector machine project. More refinement and documentation for this one is coming soon.

I plan to put out rough versions of adaboost and a demonstration of server client IP interactions soon.
